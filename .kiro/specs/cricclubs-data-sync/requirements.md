# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables downloading complete team details and match details from CricClubs and storing them in a local SQL database. This serves as the foundation for a future .NET API and Angular UI system. The MVP focuses on data extraction and local storage capabilities to establish a reliable data pipeline from CricClubs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cricket data administrator, I want to download team details from CricClubs, so that I can maintain a local copy of team information for analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to CricClubs THEN it SHALL authenticate successfully using valid credentials
2. WHEN team data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve complete team details including team name, players, contact information, and statistics
3. WHEN team data is downloaded THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and completeness before processing
4. IF team data is invalid or incomplete THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with valid records
5. WHEN team data is processed THEN the system SHALL store it in the local SQL database with proper data types and constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cricket data administrator, I want to download match details from CricClubs, so that I can maintain a comprehensive local database of match information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN match data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve complete match details including scores, player statistics, match dates, and venue information
2. WHEN match data is downloaded THEN the system SHALL handle different match formats (T20, ODI, Test) appropriately
3. WHEN match data contains player statistics THEN the system SHALL capture batting, bowling, and fielding statistics accurately
4. IF match data references teams not yet in the local database THEN the system SHALL handle the dependency gracefully
5. WHEN match data is processed THEN the system SHALL store it with proper relationships to team and player records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cricket data administrator, I want the system to handle data synchronization reliably, so that I can trust the integrity of the local database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data download fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN duplicate records are encountered THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than create duplicates
3. WHEN the download process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL resume from the last successful checkpoint
4. IF CricClubs API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL respect the limits and queue requests appropriately
5. WHEN data synchronization completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of records processed, updated, and any errors encountered

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cricket data administrator, I want to configure the data download process, so that I can control what data is synchronized and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to specify CricClubs credentials and connection settings
2. WHEN setting up synchronization THEN the administrator SHALL be able to select specific teams or competitions to download
3. WHEN scheduling downloads THEN the system SHALL support both manual and automated synchronization modes
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent execution
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cricket data administrator, I want to monitor the data download process, so that I can ensure the system is working correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data download is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators
2. WHEN errors occur during download THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
3. WHEN download completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report showing success/failure statistics
4. IF data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review
5. WHEN viewing logs THEN the administrator SHALL be able to filter by date range, severity level, and operation type
